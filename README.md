# solr installer
This code works just fine in Ubuntu 14. Does NOT work on Ubuntu 16.

This script  
(1) obtains a copy of Apache Solr, then  
(2) Starts it &  
(3) Creates a Solr collection


It also install some nice-to have python utilities on your server to ingest content into solr.

It's handy to have a solr server runnig quickly. ;)

Requirements:  
> Run it on Ubuntu 14 servers (get quickly at c9.io, aws, godaddy, etc.)
