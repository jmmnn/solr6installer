# solr installer
This code works just fine.

This script (1) obtains a copy of Apache Solr
, then (2) Starts it & (3)
Creates a Solr collection.

It also install some nice-to have python utilities on your server to ingest content into solr.

It's handy to have a solr server runnig quickly. ;)

Requirements:
> Run it on Ubuntu servers.
> Get started quickly using an instance in c9.io
